3 is Pen

each digit is a corresponding level from left to right.
A game where you do Controllers, Hands, Pen has a latin square code 123.
Likewise, Pen, Hands, Controllers has a code 321.
if you are just doing controllers and hands, the code is 12.
if you are doing hands then controllers it is 21.
if only doing controllers the code is 1.

When the each level starts, you have to complete 5 successful spell castings, or time expires at 10 minutes.

After the tasks are completed or time expires, the next level will proceed.
