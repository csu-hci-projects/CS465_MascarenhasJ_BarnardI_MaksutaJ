Notes:
  We used github Issues for task tracking so you can see the history of who worked on what there.
  - Jaden did the Controller and 3d environment, town, wand, training dummy assets
  - Isabella did the Pen and other tasks in Github (see Github Issues)
  - John did Hands and Voice, Task/Gesture/Voice Recognition, Game, Game Levels, InputSources/Manager, Logging/Reports, etc..

You must provide a link in the readme file to view them. You will also need to provide a link to download the actual video files.
Please verify with me if you are not sure. Don't make assumptions.
