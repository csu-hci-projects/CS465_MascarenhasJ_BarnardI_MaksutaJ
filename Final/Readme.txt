Notes:
  We used github Issues for task tracking so you can see the history of who worked on what there.
  - Jaden did the Controller and 3d environment, town, wand, training dummy assets
  - Isabella did the Pen and other tasks in Github (see Github Issues)
  - John did Hands and Voice, Task/Gesture/Voice Recognition, Game, Game Levels, InputSources/Manager, Logging/Reports, etc..

You must provide a link in the readme file to view them. You will also need to provide a link to download the actual video files.

Instructions on how to use your app:

Obtain or create a Latin Square code:
1 is Controllers
2 is Hands
3 is Pen

each digit is a corresponding level from left to right.
A game where you do Controllers, Hands, Pen has a latin square code 123.
Likewise, Pen, Hands, Controllers has a code 321.
if you are just doing controllers and hands, the code is 12.
if you are doing hands then controllers it is 21.
if only doing controllers the code is 1.

When the each level starts, you have to complete 5 successful spell castings, or time expires at 10 minutes.

After the tasks are completed or time expires, the next level will proceed.


There are 3 spells, each has a voice component, and a gesture component. you must activate the voice before speaking and release activation when finished speaking. Activation is performed using the left controller, left hand, or the pen.

The gestures need not be perfect and can be performed with a constant motion also, moving back and forth through the traced symbol. For instance to do a fireball, one can continuously sweep their right hand from bottom left to top right and from top right to bottom left.

To activate speech:
Controller:
	Press the X button.
Hands:
	Make Shaka gesture (surfer gesture. The thumb and pinky fingers extended. The index, middle and ring fingers curled.)
Pen:
	Press other button on grip furthest from tip.

Spells:
Spell:	Fireball
Voice Component: "Cast Fireball" or "Fireball"
Gesture: a slash from bottom left to top right.

Spell: Charm
Voice Component: "Cast Charm" or "Charm"
Gesture:  a back slash from top left to bottom right.

Spell: Smoke
Voice Component: "Cast Smoke" or "Smoke"
Gesture: a circle.
